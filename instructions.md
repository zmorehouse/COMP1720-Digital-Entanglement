# instructions

- Need a webcam
- Need good lighting. If the light is behind u (face is washed out) it wont work
- Need to take off glasses (needs to be able to see your eyes)
- There is a debugger if needed
- There are 26 (~2 mins) worth of instances to blink through before the artwork concludes
- If all else fails, you can turn off the blink and simply use the spacebar (and pretend :)
- Can press space as a failsafe
