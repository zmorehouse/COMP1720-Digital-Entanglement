## Facial Detection & Blink Detection Resources
Obviously a large part of my sketch revolves around blink detection and facemesh. While I ended up going with the handsfree.js library (and Golan's approach), I did a fair bit of research before deciding on this point. Below are both sketches I used directly within my final work, and some additional points of reference.

## Additional Works & Inspiration
Several works inspired me to create Digital Entanglement. While Philip Larkins' Aubade is woven throughout as the core text, I almost included T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land instead. Both of these poems discuss the fragmentation of modern life - well before technology existed as it does today. 

Ryoji Ikeda is a Japanese immersive media artist who I've studied in the past and was also a huge . I have taken alot of inspiration from his unique visual style, specifically from micro macro. 

Finally, the mentioned sketch from Bestesaylar was the inspiration for the blink technology in the first place.
