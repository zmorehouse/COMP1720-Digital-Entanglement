Theme entangled realities



Poem : 
Phillip Larkin, Aubade
alienation, existential dread, mechanical routine of modern life and technology

A response to the extremities of the digital realm, getting sucked in, our influence on it, 
Time is linear you cannot return - represented by blinking and the tunnel that caves in around the user. 
"You blinked and the world rewrote itself."; - filters on webcam, the digital effects the physical can you feel it effecting you.
"Entangled in digital streams. Are you still in control or just another line of code?";

By moving through 5 sets of 5 scenes the artwork represents different digital entaglements. It aims to offer a consistency with each scene having a general theme, that intensifies as the user goes through it. These relate to the stanzas of the poem

steps through different realities / digital realities of the users. 


Blink and you'll miss it!
- Interaction is prompted through movement. The sketch is revolved around the user encouraging the user move and blinking
THere is light interaction with the mouse but overall sketch wants to get ppl to move
