# Artist Statement

*You blinked and the world rewrote itself. Are you still in control, or just another line of code?*

My major project, Digital Entanglement, critiques society's increasing overreliance on digital technologies and their effect on our perception of reality. Unfolding across five scenes - each corresponding to a stanza from Philip Larkin’s Aubade - the artwork offers a contemporary exploration into themes of interdependence, existential dread, and postmodern alienation. Interpreted through a computational lens, the piece transforms these ideas into surreal digital landscapes where technology and reality intersect.

Interaction lies at the heart of Digital Entanglement. Using data from the viewer’s webcam, the piece invites viewers to experience how their own physical presence is depicted in a digital environments. Crucially, the piece never reveals the user’s image directly. Instead, it distorts and fragments their likeness, forcing the viewer to question what is real and what is simulated. Physical movement, both by the viewer and within the viewer’s environment, is encouraged - directly influencing the visuals and allowing individuals to experience a dynamic, real-time portrayal of how the digital realm can reshape and redefine one’s sense of self.

Blinking - a typically subconscious action - is the driving force behind the piece, advancing the artwork through its many stages. This design choice constrains the artwork to the linearity of real time. Each blink symbolises a moment lost - an action that cannot be undone - emphasising the inevitability of progression and underscoring how every digital interaction leaves an indelible mark on us.

Secondary gestures, such as mouse and keyboard inputs, are also available - introducing additional glitch effects and distortions. These however, have been kept intentionally subtle, serving a supportive role. In doing so, the artwork encourages viewers to engage primarily through physical movement, emphasising the significance of instinctive actions and demonstrating how our real-world presence can actively shape and influence the digital realm.

In this way, Digital Entanglement presents a layered exploration of our complex relationship with technology - urging viewers to question whether we shape the digital world or if, increasingly, it shapes us.
